# RPGGame
Simple JavaFX MVC styled project that allows user to input commands into a prompt to battle enemies until the player is defeated. 

To run the file, simply download the code and run it as you typically run a Java file in the command line 

I created this project to refresh myself on my Java skills, as well as dive back into JavaFX, a library I have not used in awhile either.
